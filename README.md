The game.

> I use 2D  arrays to store both the player's and the computer's ships in a pre-determined grid.

> The AI , now uses a pretty simple random function to hit your ships.

> Right now , the game has a 10x10 grid, an 1x5 ship, an 1x4 ship , a 1x3 ship and two 1x2 ships per combatant.

> We use 3 arrays to store items for each thing : one to use for waves , wich is displayed for the COMPUTER's grid , the COMPUTER's actual grid , wich is hidden from you , but it's used in the game, and the player's grid, wich  is shown in the game.

>  In the future i will make the enemy's grid randomly generated, and allow the player to place their ships wherever they please.
